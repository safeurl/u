                <br />

                We do not guarantee, represent or warrant that your use of our service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free.<br />
                <br />

                We do not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable.<br />

                <br />

                In no case shall U, our directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, interns, suppliers, service providers or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental,

                made available via the service, even if advised of their possibility. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or
                jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.<br />
                <br />

                violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.<br />
                <br />

                <h3>SECTION 12 - SEVERABILITY</h3>
                <br />

                In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the
                unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.<br />
                <br />

                <h3>SECTION 13 - TERMINATION</h3>
                <br />

                The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.<br />
                <br />

                These Terms of Service are effective unless and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using
                our site.<br />
                <br />

                If in our sole judgment you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any term or provision of these Terms of Service, we also may terminate this agreement at any time without notice and you will remain liable
                for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or accordingly may deny you access to our Services (or any part thereof).<br />
                <br />

                <h3>SECTION 14 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
                <br />

                The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br />
                <br />

                These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to The Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service,

                <br />

                Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting party.<br />
